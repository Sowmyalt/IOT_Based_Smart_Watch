# IoT-Based Smart Safety Watch

## 📌 Description
This project is an IoT-based smart safety watch developed using Arduino Nano.
When an SOS button is pressed, the device sends an emergency alert with
location details via a GSM module.

## 🧠 Working Principle
1. The system is powered using a lithium-ion battery with a DC-DC buck converter.
2. Pressing the SOS button triggers the Arduino Nano.
3. The GSM module sends an SMS containing a Google Maps location link.
4. A call is also initiated to the emergency contact.
5. An LED indicates successful alert triggering.
